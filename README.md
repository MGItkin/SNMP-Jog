# SNMP-Jog
SNMP Jog is a trimmed down, utility first implementation of the traditional SnmpWalk command merged with a simple management station. Jog can be run via command line and focuses on providing only the most important information in a readable, comparative manner. 

Jog reports three main categories of information:

1. Agent interfaces
2. Connected Devices
3. Traffic throughput
